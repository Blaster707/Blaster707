# Hey there!  I'm Lucas.

Hello there!  My name is Lucas; others know me as Blaster707.  By trade, I am currently a Biomedical Technician, but I am looking to
permanently switch to Software Engineering soon.  I have always been curious about programming, but just never 
seemed to have the time to devote to learning how to do it.  Eventually, though, curiosity killed the cat (with some 
help from a close friend) and I pushed myself to finally dive in.

### Udemy

When I was younger, I had a little bit of experience with Java, and I took some classes in it at the local science museum.
However, when I decided to really buckle down, the language I learned was Kotlin.  I did this via the Udemy Kotlin Development
Masterclass (https://www.udemy.com/course/kotlinmasterclass/)

### LeetCode

I've been getting a handle on basic data structures, algorithms, and am slowly moving on to more challenging tasks.  
Most of this practice was done using LeetCode - the exercises I've completed can be found on my LeetCode repo (https://github.com/Blaster707/leetcode).

### Learning Project: Contact List

I've since moved on to a combined project to use the skills I've learned on something more challenging than single LeetCode exercises.
I decided to make a Contact List program, incorporating custom classes, objects, and more- going beyond building with just
primitives.  Its most recent iteration uses HTTP as an interface, and stores to a JSON file on disk.  This can be found on my 
contact-list repo (https://github.com/Blaster707/contact-list).
